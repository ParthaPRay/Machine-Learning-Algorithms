This repo contains the the landscape of machine learning algorithms

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):

Delve into the intricate world of ANNs, including Classical, Supervised, and Unsupervised Learning. Understand how ANNs power various applications like Clustering, Classification, and even the revolutionary Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Regression and Pattern Search:

Uncover the magic of Regression techniques, and how Pattern Search, Boosting, Stacking, and Bagging algorithms work in synergy to enhance predictive power and model accuracy.

Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization:

Discover the importance of Dimensionality Reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE in simplifying complex data structures, followed by an insight into Ensemble Learning and its role in amalgamating multiple models for robust predictions.

Reinforcement Learning (RL):

Journey into the world of RL, where we explore Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge Regression, Fuzzy C-Means, and more. Gain a deeper understanding of RL through SARSA, Genetic Algorithm, Q-Learning, and the dynamic A3C algorithm.

Neural Networks for Sequences:

Unearth the power of Neural Networks in handling sequences with models like LSTM, GRU, seq2seq, and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), followed by GradientBoost, Random Forest, and the innovative DCNN for advanced applications.

Supervised Learning Techniques:

Delve into key algorithms like CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Apriori for association rule mining. Understand how these techniques enable accurate predictions and insights from structured data.

Unsupervised Learning Approaches:

Demystify the world of kNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Polynomial Regression, and grasp the nuances of algorithms like k Means, Mean-Shift, and DBSCAN for clustering tasks.
